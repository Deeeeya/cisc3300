2. What is SQL? MySQL? What are relational databases? → SQL is a language that is used to query and manipulate databases, while MySQL is a relational database program (one of many) that uses SQL queries.
3. What is normalization in SQL? → It avoids data duplication by using relationships where tables are divided into smaller related tables and use foreign keys to link them.
