Homework 2 

1. What do the id and class attributes do? How are they alike and different?

- ‘Id’ attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element, only one element can have a specific id, while a class attribute is used to define HTML elements but can be shared by multiple elements.
- Both are used to style elements in CSS or in javascript and are applied to HTML elements, however, ids are unique while class attributes can be reused.

2. What are the parts of a CSS rule? 

- The selector targets html elements
- The declaration block contains the styles that are applied and are enclosed in curly braces
- The declaration which consists of a property and its value (color: red;)

3. Explain how CSS rules cascade. 

- CSS rules cascade depending on the source order, like rules overriding earlier rules or the specificity where id’s override class attributes.

4. Contrast display: block, inline, inline-block. 

- Block: starts on a new line and takes up full width available
- Inline: does not start on a new line and only takes up width as necessary
- Inline-block: acts like inline, but allows properties like width and height

5. What are border, padding, and margin? 

- Border is the boundary around the contend and padding of an element
- Padding is the space between the content and element’s border
- Margin is the space outside the border which separates the element from other elements
