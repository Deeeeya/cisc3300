1. What is HTML? What does it do?
HTML is a markup language, which is a set of rules that defines how the layout and presentation of text and images should appear in a digital document. It allows for structuring documents, adding formatting, and specifying how different elements should be displayed or rendered on webpages.

2. Access https://www.fordham.edu/. In your own words, describe how this webpage uses structure to convey meaning and navigation options to the user.
This webpage is formatted neatly and made easily accessible to people. They have a fixed navigation bar on the top of the page to allow students to access it wherever they are on the page; they don’t have to scroll all the way up. You also notice how the page has separate sections to convey the purpose of the section; one section is used to list upcoming events, and another is to show articles published by Fordham students.

3. What is an HTML element? Tag? Attribute? 
HTML elements are building blocks of web pages, representing different types of content such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. It is a collection of start and end tags with the content inserted between them. 
Tags are like containers that enclose content inside them. For example, ‘<p>’ is the opening tag, and ‘</p>’ is the closing tag.
An attribute provides additional information about the contents of an element.

4. What does it mean when an element has semantic meaning? And structural meaning? 
When an element has a semantic meaning, it means they are intended to convey meaning by its element type, even if the element is indistinguishable from other elements visually.
Structural meaning has an effect on the structure of the page but doesn’t necessarily convey any meaning by its element type.

5. What is the default behavior when submitting an HTML form? 
A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server
