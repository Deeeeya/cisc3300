Homework 6 

1. Define hoisting and closures in JS.
- Hoisting is when variables and functions within each execution context are created before execution.
- Closures are when in each JavaScript execution context, the scope is the current execution context's variables object, plus the variables object for each parent execution context.
2. What is PHP? What do server-side languages do in web development? 
- PHP is a scripting language designed for web development to create dynamic web pages and manage databases. Server-side languages handle the backend, they process requests from clients to retrieve or manipulate data and return responses.
3. What are some examples of how the PHP and JavaScript programming languages are alike and how they differ? 
- Similarities: Both are used for web development, interact with databases and handle form submissions. They also use variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- Differences: PHP runs on the server, while JavaScript runs on the browser. PHP is used for backend development, while JavaScript is used for mostly Frontend.
4. Why pick PHP over another server-side scripting language like Python or Node?
- It is optimized for handling HTTP requests, and its simple syntax and built-in functions for web development.
5. Compare and contrast echo and var_dump.
- echo is used to output text or variables to the frontend, and it is faster and simpler since it does not return a value.
- var-dump is used to display detailed information about a variable, specifically its data type, and value. It is also used to debug complex data like arrays and objects
