Homework 4 
1. How does an interpreted programming language differ from a compiled language? 
- Interpreted languages are usually slower than a compiled language because code is executed line by line by an interpreter during runtime, but they are more flexible while a compiled language runs faster because code is translated into machine code before it is executed by a compiler, but it requires extra steps.
2. Contrast dynamically typed programming languages with statically typed ones. And contrast strongly typed programming languages with weakly typed ones. 
- Dynamically typed programming languages' variable types are determined at runtime while the variable types in statistically typed ones are defined at compile-time.
- Strongly typed programming languages prevent implicit type conversions which leads to errors while weakly typed ones allow implicit type coercion.
3. What is the difference between var, let, and const when declaring variables in JS? 
- ‘var’ is function scoped, and can be redeclared and hoisted.
- ‘let’ is block-scoped which means it cannot be redeclared but it can be hoisted but not initialized like var.
- ‘const’ is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared or reassigned. It however can be hoisted but not initialized.
4. What are anonymous functions? Higher order functions? Callback functions? First class functions? 
- Anonymous functions are functions without a name which are mainly used as arguments in other functions.
- High-order functions are functions that take another function as an argument or return a function.
- Callback functions are functions passed as an argument to another function to be executed later
- First-class functions are functions that are treated as variables and can be assigned, passed or returned.
5. Define objects in JavaScript. 
- Objects in JavaScript are data types that are used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
